    ---

    These steps are followed in order until a coding decision is made. Assume, for instance, that an answer is coded
    Do Fo H. It meets the criteria listed in Step 1 for GHR. It is a Pure H response, with o form quality, and has no
    Special Scores. Conversely, if the coding were Do Fo Hd, the decision would not be made at Step 1 because the
    content is Hd, rather than Pure H. The answer would finally be classified as PHR at Step 6 because of the Hd
    content coding. Other illustrations, showing the step at which the coding decision is made, are shown below:

    | Card | Response Coding                 | GHR/PHR Decision    |
